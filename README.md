****Description****:

Captain Yoo Si-jin (played by Song Joong-ki), a member of South Korea’s special forces, and his friend Master Sergeant Seo Dae-young (Jin Goo) are off duty when they stop a motorcycle thief, Kim Gi-bum (Kim Min-seok), using toy guns from a shooting game. During the scuffle, Kim is injured and taken to the hospital, where the soldiers go to retrieve Dae-young’s stolen phone. There, Si-jin meets Dr. Kang Mo-yeon (Song Hye-kyo) and is immediately drawn to her. However, Mo-yeon mistakenly believes Si-jin is involved with the thief after overhearing Dae-young call him by his military call sign, “Big Boss.” Si-jin clears up the misunderstanding with the help of military doctor Yoon Myung-ju (Kim Ji-won), Mo-yeon’s old academic rival.

Si-jin and Mo-yeon begin dating, but their relationship struggles due to his unpredictable military duties. Si-jin is later deployed on a peacekeeping mission to the war-torn fictional country of Uruk. Meanwhile, Mo-yeon, disillusioned after being denied a promotion due to favoritism at the hospital, confronts Si-jin when he returns, questioning the secrecy of his work. Their differing worldviews—Si-jin kills to protect lives, while Mo-yeon saves them as a doctor—cause them to amicably break up. Dae-young also grapples with his feelings for Myung-ju, as their relationship risks violating military rules, especially since she is the daughter of their commanding officer.

Eight months later, Mo-yeon is sent to Uruk as punishment for rejecting her hospital director’s romantic interest. There, she reunites with Si-jin. As they work through a devastating earthquake, a deadly virus outbreak, and threats from a local warlord who was once Si-jin’s ally, they grow closer. Mo-yeon accidentally confesses her love, and the two officially rekindle their romance. She eventually accepts the dangers of Si-jin’s job and the secrecy that comes with it. At the same time, Dae-young finally shows his feelings for Myung-ju after she survives the virus.

Back in Korea, Si-jin and Mo-yeon continue their relationship until Si-jin and Dae-young disappear during a covert mission and are presumed dead. Mo-yeon grieves his loss and honors his memory by volunteering in Albania, where Si-jin unexpectedly reunites with her. Her colleagues, shocked to see him during a video call, mistake him for a ghost as she had just held a memorial for him. Meanwhile, Dae-young reunites with Myung-ju in Uruk, where Gi-bum—now a soldier—has taken over Dae-young’s old post. Si-jin explains that he and Dae-young were saved by a North Korean soldier he had once helped. The story ends with all four—Si-jin, Mo-yeon, Myung-ju, and Dae-young—happily reunited.
