### fav character
- Tetsuya Kuroko


****Description****:
Kuroko has a deadpan and straightforward personality. He is very hard working and always tries to satisfy the needs of the team above his own. He has no presence and is quite unnoticeable, a trait that goes well with his misdirection. He has also displayed much respect towards fellow passionate basketball players and thinks that while senpais have to have pride, kōhais need to have respect.[2] Despite his initial kind personality, Kuroko gets extremely furious at dirty play, such as when his teammates were threatened and injured by foul methods in the Kirisaki Daīchi game. His aura changes so drastically, that even Kagami gets scared when he sees him like that.[3] When Kuroko gets angry, it gets very hard to beat him, as he is filled up with fighting spirit. When the situation worsens, he seems to turn talkative.[4]

Prior in his days in Teiko, he used to have more emotion, determination, and compassion for basketball at the 5th grade when he watched, he seems exasperated as he struggles for joining, when he is now a regular, he is somehow happy and smiling that he could die, however when Akashi, Aomine, and the rest of the Miracles where becoming distant, Kuroko was fed up due to his team's arrogance, cold-hearted play, and lack of joy for basketball, in the match between Meiko, he couldn't bear watching as he is now filled with sorrow, and grief, as a result, he quits the team and becoming antisocial, however, Ogiwara notes that Kuroko's eyes were just like the Miracles, but filled with warmth, he says to Kuroko to never stop playing basketball,through Mochida, because of this Kuroko is now determined to proved his style of basketball, as he chose Seirin due to their teamplay is filled with fun, encouraging him to join their team.

He has metaphorically referred to himself as a "shadow."[5] He means that he is playing for someone else, and that he becomes stronger when the "light" is stronger. The "light" would be the player he supports during a basketball game. During his Junior High school basketball career, his "light" was Aomine, and now it is Kagami.

His philosophy in teamplay somehow had a point, but after the first Too match, he learns from Kiyoshi and Kagami that its not just teamplay to achieve victory, but also individual skills, leading to his training to improve himself. His mental will proves to be extremely high and somehow "reckless" when Kuroko faces the enemies when it comes to basketball as he did it twice with the bullies of certain school, and Jabberwock, as Kagami pointing his stupidity, even Midorima remarks the unbelievable thing that Kuroko done, and surprising Akashi as he noted himself to Kuroko's straightforward confrontation against Jabberwock.

Outside the court, despite his unnoticeable personality, Kuroko is very gentlemanly when dealing with women. Amongst his friends, Kagami, Aomine and Kise are really shocked to see how easily Kuroko can cheer up Momoi and even knows what to do on a date.[6] Kuroko also lectures Kagami that he should deal with women more delicately.
